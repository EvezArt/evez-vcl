## What is this?

EVEZ generates **visual cognition artifacts** from AI agent interactions — making agent reasoning visible, auditable, and trustworthy.

| Artifact | What It Shows | Format |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Seed Memory Anchor** | Stable memory state burned into pixels | PNG |
| **Attention Overlay** | What the agent paid attention to | PNG |
| **Cognition Flow** | Dynamic thought trace as animated flow field | MP4 |
| **Best Layout** | Compressed concept map — the "mind snapshot" | PNG |
| **Manifest** | Machine-readable provenance + metadata | JSON |

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 tools/evez.py init
python3 tools/run_all.py --seed --mode spicy
```

## Play Forever

```bash
python3 tools/evez.py play --loop --steps 14
```

The game can't end because the attack surface can't end.

## Who This Is For

- **AI Safety teams** — attention traces for alignment review
- **Education** — visual reasoning for teaching
- **Enterprise** — audit artifacts for compliance
- **Product teams** — trust UX for end users

## Deployment

Runs fully offline. Zero cloud dependencies. Python 3.10+.
